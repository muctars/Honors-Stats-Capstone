# Honors-Stats-Capstone

This project was developed in my Honors Introduction to Statistics class that I took at Sacramento City College. I thought of the idea of performing this analysis because I have always had a fascination with different countries around the world. This project was a perfect combination for combining all the skill that I learned throughout the class and learning more about the world around me

This read me will serve as a visual summary as to how I carried out the project as well as the results as I found

To start off, I will define some terms:

nominal gross domestic product: a measure of a countryâ€™s GDP using current prices without adjusting for inflation

Economic Freedom Index:  a yearly ranking created by the right-wing think tank Heritage Foundation and the index measures countries based on four broad attributes: rule of law, government size, regulatory efficiency, and open markets. A score that a country can receive in this ranking is between 0 and 100.

There are many other ranking systems just like the economic freedom index; I happened to pick this one since the data was redily avaliable in Excel.
